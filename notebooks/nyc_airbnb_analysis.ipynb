    "2. **Room Type Distribution**  \n",

    "   - **Shared rooms** are rare, with only ~1,000 listings.\n",

    "   - **Williamsburg** and **Bedford-Stuyvesant** have the highest number of listings (3,500–4,000).  \n",
    "   - **Harlem** and **Bushwick** follow, while the remaining neighborhoods in the top 10 range between 1,500–2,000 listings.\n",

    "4. **Price vs. Number of Reviews**  \n",
    "   - Most reviews cluster in listings priced between **$50 and $250**.  \n",
    "   - **Private rooms and shared rooms** dominate lower price ranges, especially around $100.  \n",
    "   - Listings above **$150** are mostly **Entire home/apartment**, showing a correlation between price and property type.\n",

    "-The Airbnb dataset for NYC reveals key insights into listing distribution, pricing, and guest engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Most listings are concentrated in popular neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The majority of listings are priced under $250 per night, with only a small fraction categorized as ultra-luxury ($800+).\n",
    "\n",
    "-Room type distribution shows a dominance of Entire Home/Apartments, followed by Private and Shared rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The interactive map visualization helped identify how pricing and review popularity vary geographically.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Ultra-luxury listings tend to cluster in specific neighborhoods and maintain high review counts, indicating strong demand despite high prices.\n",

    "-Data cleaning decisions, such as handling missing values and filtering extreme price outliers, improved analysis accuracy without losing significant information."
